Embedding New Information into Referring Expressions This paper focuses on generating referring expressions capable of serving multiple communicative goals .
The components of a referring expression are divided into a referring part and a non - referring part .
Two rules for the content determination and construction of the non - referring part are given , which are realised in an embedding algorithm .
The significant aspect of our approach is that it intends to generate the non - referring part given the restrictions imposed by the referring part , whose realisation is , on the other hand , affected by the non - referring part .
1 .
Components of a Referring Expression .
The referring expression is a very important and complex construction in languages .
It can serve multiple communicative goals including referring to an object , providing new information about it , and expressing the speaker 's emotional attitude towards it ( Appelt , 1985 ) .
Although a formal model of referring built within the framework of a general theory of speech acts and rationality is given in ( Appelt and Kronfeld , 1987 ) , and this can be used to explain how referring acts achieve multiple goals , there is a gap between the general model and the planning of the linguistic content of a referring expression .
We divide the constituents in a referring expression I into two parts based on their communicative goals and the rules for their content determination and realisation .
They are a referring part , which intends to refer to an object and a non - referring part , which intends to provide additional new information about the object .
For example , in " the actual writing style of Xuanzong , who was a well - known calligrapher " , the bold faced items belong to the referring part , and the underlined ones to the non - referring part .
The division is a pragmatic one and the two parts are closely related to each other .
On the one hand , the referring part puts both syntactic and semantic ~Only singular referring expressions that are primarily for referring to physical objects are considered here .
constraints on the presenting of the non - referring part .
The syntactic constraint concerns mainly the available syntactic slots around the head .
The semantic constraint will be introduced in section 3 .
On the other hand , the possibility of adding a nonreferring part can make some realisations of a referent preferred over others .
When generating referring expressions , multiple factors should be considered , which include Centering Theory ( Grosz et aL , 1995 ) and stylistic preferences such as avoiding too many repetitions .
If we are to satisfy all constraints to some extent , we may need to consider more than one possible realisation of a referent , choosing among those that do not significantly affect the coherence of the text .
Then one of the realisations that is most suitable for adding new information can be selected .
A great amount of work has been done on generating various types of referring expressions , which addresses the referring part , while little has addressed the generation issues with respect to the other part , except that in ( Scott and de Souza , 1990 ) , the relation between embedding and rhetorical relations is discussed and several heuristics for combining sentences using embedding are given .
But this is far from enough for generating an appropriate referring expression .
System Architecture .
We design an algorithm to generate referring expressions consisting of both parts .
The referring pan is generated by the referring process ( Dale , 1992 ) , while the non - referring pan is generated by a subtype of the aggregation process called embedding , which selects suitable facts and realises them as components within the structure of a referring expression .
The algorithm fits into the text planner of ILEX ( Oberlander et al . , 1998 ) .
ILEX is an adaptive hypertext system generating museum object descriptions .
In ILEX , pieces of domain knowledge that may be worth expressing in a text are represented as nodes and links in a graph called the Content Potential .
Two kinds of nodes useful for referring expression generation are entity nodes and fact nodes 2 .
A fact is represented as Predicate(Argl , Arg2 ) .
A revised version of Text Structure ( TS ) ( Meteer , 1992 ) is used as an intermediate level of representation between the text planner and the sentence realiser , which provides syntactic constraints to the text planner while abstracting away from linguistic details .
The Text Structure uses a unified representation for structures both above and below sentence level , so that abstract sentence planning can be done in text planning .
The text generation process follows roughly four steps : 1 ) The text planner selects a set of facts to be expressed and the best rhetorical relations between them 3 .
2 ) The text planner builds the TS for each fact in the set .
For each entity in a chosen fact , the referring process produces a list of possible realisations that will unambiguously refer ( the referring part ) .
Based on the constraints imposed by the referring part , the embedding process finds from the set all the unexpressed facts whose Argls are that entity 4 , and makes embedding decisions including what to embed , what syntactic form the embedded parts should take and which realisation for the entity is preferred , according to the principles in the next section .
This step iterates until the TS for all facts is built .
3 ) The aggregation process goes through the TS for parataxis possibilities .
4 ) The appropriately simplified TS is sent to the surface realiser , where the natural language text is generated .
We distinguish between two types of parataxis : semantic and textual .
Semantic parataxis concerns facts that have two identical semantic constituents or a rhetorical relation between them , while textual parataxis deals with any adjacent facts from text planning , with no rhetorical connection between .
In step 3 ) , both types of parataxis are performed .
Generating the Non - Referring Part .
A referring expression is primarily for referring to an entity .
So the addition of a non - referring part should not interfere with this primary function .
We summarise two principles that the non - referring part must obey , which have been realised in our embedding algorithm in a simple way .
2Each entity node corresponds to a domain object ; each fact node represents a relation between two entities and can be expressed as a single sentence in language .
3Details of the text planning algorithm can be found in ( Oberlander et al . , 1998 ) .
4The chosen fact actually forms the nucleus of Elaboration , and the facts collected by embedding form the satellites .
1 .
The non - referring part should not confuse the reader about the referent indicated by the referring part .
That is , if the referring part can uniquely identify the referent , the reader should not be confused over which object the referring expression is about because of the addition of the nonreferring part .
For example , in the description of a currently focal object which is a necklace , we might say " The necklace is made from gold " .
Suppose we also want to inform the readers that the necklace has floral motifs .
We should use " The necklace , which has floral motifs , is made from gold " rather than " The necklace with floral motifs is made from gold " because the latter may make the readers think that the sentence is about a necklace which is not the focal object .
Based on both the properties of English and our analysis of real museum descriptions , we find that additional information is provided by evaluative adjectives , non - restrictive clauses , and almost all grammatical constituents in an indefinite and a demonstrative noun phrase .
These characteristics are captured by embedding rules .
For example , the definition of one rule that embeds a prepositional phrase is : In the definition , priority is the order in which the rule should be tried , where those rules producing simpler syntactic forms always have higher priority ( Scott and de Souza , 1990 ) ; constraints is the restrictions that must be satisfied by the predicate and arguments of the embedded fact and the realisation of the referring part .
In the above example , the required semantic category of the predicate is specified , which is used to select suitable facts for embedding ; RT is the resource tree for building the TS for the embedded component .
Assume we have two facts Fl = style(J1 , Organic ) and F2 = hasqual(J1,Floral - motif ) .
Without using embedding , we might generate " The necklace is in the Organic style .
It has floral motifs " .
Suppose F1 and F2 are selected by the text planner and the embedding process respectively , and the referring form of the entity Jl can be demonstrative , definite or pronoun .
Applying the above embedding rule , we would realise F2 as a post - modifier of the Argl of F1 , and choose demonstrative , as " This necklace with floral motifs is in the Organic style " .
2 .
The non - referring part should not reduce the readability of the text .
There are several restrictions concerning readability : 1 ) Complexity of a referring expression : the generated expressions should not be too complex to read .
We use a fixed number of syntactic slots to restrict the maximum amount of information that can be expressed .
But the actual complexity is decided by user models .
At present we only distinguish between adults and children .
According to observations in psycholinguistic research , embedded clauses in subjects are a major obstacle to comprehensibility ( Coleman , 1962 ) .
So for children , the system generates fewer non - restrictive clauses than for adults and none at all in subjects .
2 ) Compatibility with other aggregation possibilities : only semantic paratactic and hypotactic relations between facts are considered here .
Complex embedded components like non - restrictive clauses may interrupt the semantic connection between a set of sentences .
For example , if we do not consider such connections while making embedding decisions , we would generate a sentence like : " This jewel is made of gold , sapphire , a kind of precious stone and enamel which is often used to produce a shiny surface " .
It is not good compared with : " This jewel is made of gold , sapphire and enamel .
Sapphire is a kind of precious stone , and enamel is often used to produce a shiny surface " .
Adjectives would not have such negative effect in most cases , especially when the paratactic parts have syntactically symmetrical modifications , like " The bracelet has a slightly flared band and a swelling midsection . " Prepositional phrases fall between adjectives and relative clauses in their effect .
Also when one fact is to be embedded , it is necessary to check if there are facts semantically related to it , which should be embedded together .
For instance , it is bad to say " The necklace , which is made from gold , is in the Organic style .
It is also made from enamel " .
So before embedding a fact , our embedding algorithm considers the possibilities of other types of aggregation , and only embeds if the embedded properties can be realised as a syntactic form other than a non - restrictive clause in possible paratactic nuclei , and all of the semantically related facts can be embedded at the same time .
This means that em - bedding has a lower priority than parataxis and hypotaxis , which reflects the relationship between the weakest rhetorical relation , Elaboration , and other types of rhetorical relations .
Future Work .
This paper discusses our ongoing work on how to embed new information into a referring expression .
While the restrictions concerning the second principle are currently implemented in a procedural way , it is possible to formalise them as constraints within the embedding rules .
An interesting problem is the relation between embedding and entity - based coherence , which exists between spans of text in virtue of shared entities ( Oberlander et al . , 1998 ) .
When a fact is embedded into another one , the entity inside it may become unavailable for an entity - based move , and the smooth transfer from this fact to its elaborating facts is cut off .
The effect of embedding on local and global coherence is to be exploited more in future work , and a comprehensive evaluation is indispensable .
